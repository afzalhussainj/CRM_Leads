# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## **Deployment Queuing Issue**

Render queues deployments - only one deployment runs at a time per service. This is normal behavior.

### **How to Handle Queued Deployments:**

#### **Option 1: Wait for Current Deployment**
- Let the current deployment finish (or fail)
- Your new deployment will automatically start afterward
- Check the dashboard to see the status

#### **Option 2: Cancel Current Deployment**
1. Go to **Render Dashboard** â†’ Your Service
2. Click on the **"Deploys"** tab
3. Find the **in-progress** deployment
4. Click **"Cancel"** button
5. Wait a few seconds, then trigger your new deployment

#### **Option 3: Force New Deployment via CLI (if needed)**
```bash
# Install Render CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g render-cli

# Login to Render
render login

# Cancel current deployment
render deployments cancel <service-id>

# Trigger new deployment
render deployments create <service-id>
```

### **Common Render Deployment States:**

- **Queued**: Waiting for previous deployment to finish
- **Building**: Docker image is being built
- **Deploying**: Container is starting
- **Live**: Deployment successful, service is running
- **Failed**: Deployment failed (check logs)

### **Why This Happens:**

Render uses a deployment queue to:
- Prevent resource conflicts
- Ensure database migrations run sequentially
- Avoid multiple containers running simultaneously
- Maintain service stability

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Wait for Build to Complete**: Let failed deployments finish or cancel them explicitly
2. **Check Logs First**: Before redeploying, check why the previous one failed
3. **Use Auto-Deploy**: Set `autoDeploy: true` in render.yaml for automatic deploys on git push
4. **Monitor Build Time**: Free tier builds can take 5-10 minutes

### **Quick Actions:**

**If deployment is stuck:**
1. Check if it's actually building (logs should show activity)
2. Wait 10-15 minutes for free tier builds
3. If truly stuck, cancel and redeploy

**If you need to deploy urgently:**
1. Cancel current deployment immediately
2. Wait 30 seconds for cancellation to process
3. Trigger new deployment

**Note**: Render's free tier has longer build times. Be patient with the first deployment - it may take 10-15 minutes.
